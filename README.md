# The Compile-O-Tron 9000

This repository contains the code for our compiler.

To compile the project, compile `Main.icl` using the iTasks environment.

The `examples` directory contains the examples from blackboard and a number of examples we have added ourselves.

The test scripts `testSomething.py` (which rely on `test.py`) test the compilation stages on the examples, given that you have compiled the corresponding `MainSomething.icl` to `spl.exe`.
